# Develop Product Feedback Survey Form Using Events

## What You Will Learn

You will learn how to create a user feedback form for a luxury brand's products using HTML and JavaScript. You will discover how to design a structured form to collect diverse user information such as name, age, email, job, and product feedback. You will see how to use the JavaScript functions to manage form submission, capture input values, and dynamically display user-provided feedback on the webpage. You will also observe event handling mechanisms.

## Learning objectives

1. Form handling and user input capture: Explore the process of creating an interactive form using HTML elements, such as text inputs, select options, and text areas, to collect diverse user information, including name, age, email, job, product feedback, and more.

2. DOM manipulation with JavaScript: Learn how JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to retrieve input values from form elements and dynamically update the webpage content. This includes modifying the display style of an HTML element and populating its content based on user input.

3. Event handling and user interactions: Explore event handling mechanisms in JavaScript, specifically the implementation of event listeners for button clicks and Enter key presses to trigger actions, such as submitting the form data and displaying feedback dynamically, providing a seamless user experience.

4. User interface interaction design: Analyse the importance of presenting collected user information in a readable format on the webpage. Learners will gain insights into dynamically displaying user-provided feedback in a structured manner within the webpage, enhancing the overall user interface and experience.

# Summary

1. Feedback form elements: The HTML structure includes input fields for name, age, email, job, designation, a dropdown for product type selection, and a textarea for feedback submission. This comprehensive design ensures the collection of user-provided information.

2. Dynamic user information display: JavaScript function "submitFeedback()" processes user input upon button click or Enter key press, displaying entered details dynamically below the form, including name, age, email, job, designation, selected product type, and the provided feedback.

3. Visibility toggle: Initially hidden, a section below the form remains concealed until feedback submission. Upon submission, JavaScript alters its display to "block," showcasing the user's information and feedback for the selected product type.

4. Event listeners implementation: Event listeners are employed to trigger the feedback submission function, enabling user interaction via both the "Submit Feedback" button click and the Enter key press for a seamless experience.
