# Display Employee Information using Array Methods

## What you will learn

You will create an employee management system. You will employ buttons to trigger functions such as displaying all employees, calculating total salaries, filtering and displaying HR department employees, and finding employees by their IDs. You will use JavaScript functions to generate dynamic lists of employees utilizimg array methods like forEach, filter, reduce, and find to manage and present data interactively.

## Learning objectives

1. Event-driven programming: Learn to trigger functions through button clicks for DOM manipulation.

2. Array method proficiency: Gain expertise in JavaScript array methods (forEach, filter, reduce, find) for data manipulation.

3. Dynamic manipulation: Understand how to create and update HTML elements within a webpage dynamically.

4. Front-end development skills: Develop foundational skills to create interactive interfaces and manage data presentation on webpages.

## Summary

1. Setting up the environment: HTML code includes three <div> to showcase employee information based on user-triggered actions without the page dynamically reloading when clicking any buttons.

2. Defining variables and functions: The map method stores employees' details in the variable totalEmployees, which shows details in the <div> element (with the help of an ID) displays employee information on the webpage while the reduce method iterates through each employee and accumulates their salaries to calculate the total.

3. Checking the output: git add, git commit, and git push commands update changes into your Scope_Lab folder; GitHub repository for proper code management.
