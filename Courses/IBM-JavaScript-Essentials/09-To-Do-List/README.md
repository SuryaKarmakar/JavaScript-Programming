# Create a To-Do List Using

## What you will learn:

You will explore the process of building a functional task management interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Follow step-by-step instructions to understand the implementation of fundamental features, including adding tasks, dynamically displaying a task list, marking tasks as completed, clearing completed tasks, and implementing live search functionality. Throughout this process, you will grasp key concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, array manipulation for task management, and filtering tasks based on user input.

## Learning objectives

1. Task management implementation: Learn the process of creating a functional task management interface by implementing features like adding tasks, displaying a task list dynamically, toggling task completion status, and clearing completed tasks using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. DOM manipulation proficiency: Gain proficiency in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to dynamically create and modify elements within the webpage, enabling real-time updates and interactions within the To-Do List application.

3. Event handling and user interaction: Explore event-driven programming by implementing event listeners for user actions such as adding tasks, toggling completion, and filtering tasks based on search input, fostering a responsive and interactive user experience.

4. Understanding front-end principles: Comprehend fundamental front-end development principles, including UI design considerations, CSS styling for layout and aesthetics, and integrating JavaScript functionalities to create a cohesive and user-friendly To-Do List application interface.

## Summary

1. HTML structure: Created essential HTML elements like title, To-Do List heading, input field, and buttons for adding tasks and clearing completed ones. Set up an empty list to display tasks.

2. Defined variables: To capture HTML elements using a document.getElementById variables were declared. Initialized an empty array of tasks to manage tasks.

3. Task management: addTask gathered user input, updated tasks, and refreshed the displayed list through displayTasks. This function dynamically generated HTML elements for each task. toggleTask and clearCompletedTasks managed task completion and removal.

4. Event handling: Set event listeners for the "Add Task" and "Clear Completed" buttons, triggering respective functions. Initially displayed existing tasks through displayTasks. This setup formed the foundation for a dynamic To-Do List, allowing smooth task addition, viewing, completion, and clearing.
