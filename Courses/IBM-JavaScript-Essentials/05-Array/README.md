# Working with Array Iteration for Restaurant Menu List

## What you will learn

You will explore how JavaScript dynamically generates restaurant menu sections for breakfast, main course, and dessert using JavaScript's array methods. You will learn to use map to populate the breakfast menu, forEach to display the main course menu items, and a traditional for loop to render the dessert items. Additionally, you will understand how HTML content can be updated dynamically, showcasing the power of JavaScript in modifying webpage elements based on predefined arrays.

## Learning objectives

1. Understanding DOM manipulation: Gain proficiency in accessing HTML elements and dynamically updating their content using JavaScript. Focus on the getElementById method to precisely alter specific elements within a webpage.

2. Array iteration methods: Differentiate between various array iteration methods like map, forEach, and for loops. Observe their distinct functionalities in iterating through arrays and generating structured HTML content.

3. Dynamic web content creation: Learn the process of dynamically generating and rendering content on a webpage by using JavaScript to create structured menus based on predefined arrays, emphasizing the dynamic nature of web development.

4. Menu section organization: Grasp the concept of organizing webpage content into sections (e.g., breakfast, main course, dessert) by populating HTML elements with data from corresponding JavaScript arrays, facilitating structured and readable webpage layouts.

5. Application of JavaScript methods: Apply JavaScript methods (map, forEach, getElementById, innerHTML) to manipulate HTML file effectively, showcasing the practical usage of these methods in generating and updating webpage content dynamically based on predefined data.

# Summary

1. HTML structure: Defines an HTML structure for a restaurant menu, categorizing items into Breakfast, Main Course, and Dessert sections using appropriate <h2> headings and <div> elements with unique IDs for content display.

2. JavaScript dynamic content: Utilizes JavaScript to dynamically populate menu items within their respective sections.

a. Breakfast menu: Uses the map method to generate HTML strings for breakfast items and inserts them into the designated <div> element.
b. Main course menu: Utilizes forEach to construct HTML strings for main course items, updating the related <div> with the generated content.
c. Dessert menu: Utilizes a for loop to create HTML strings for dessert items and inserts them into the designated <div> element for dessert items.

3. Data handling: Stores menu item data in separate JavaScript arrays (breakfastMenu, mainCourseMenu, dessertMenu) to facilitate dynamic content creation without hardcoding within the HTML structure.

4. Dynamic rendering: Illustrates how JavaScript interacts with HTML, dynamically generating and updating content within the webpage, demonstrating different iteration methods to present menu items under specific categories.
