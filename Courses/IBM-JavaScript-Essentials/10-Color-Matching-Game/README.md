# Develop Colorful Memory Match Game Using JavaScript DOM:

## What you will learn:

You will learn the fundamentals of building a memory matching game using HTML and JavaScript. You will understand how to dynamically generate game elements, such as cards with various colors, handle click events to reveal and match colors, implement a basic scoring system that increments upon successful matches, create a timer mechanism to limit game time and initiate game restart functionalities. Through this lab, you will grasp key concepts of DOM manipulation, event handling, array manipulation (shuffling), and basic game logic, offering practical insight into creating interactive web-based games.

## Learning objectives:

1. DOM manipulation: Understand and implement dynamic HTML element creation and modification using JavaScript to generate a playable memory matching game grid.

2. Event handling: Learn to manage and respond to user interactions by handling click events on game cards, revealing colors, and implementing logic for matching pairs.

3. Game logic implementation: Develop fundamental game logic by incorporating mechanisms to match pairs of colors, track scores, reset the game, and manage game time through a simple timer.

4. Fundamentals of web game development: Gain insights into core concepts essential for creating interactive web-based games, including array manipulation for shuffling elements, styling elements with CSS, and integrating JavaScript functionalities for game interactivity and dynamics.
