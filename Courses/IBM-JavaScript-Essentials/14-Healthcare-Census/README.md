# Develop an Application for Healthcare Census:

## What you will learn:

You will learn to build interactive forms using HTML and employ JavaScript to collect and manage patient data.

This project will help you understand DOM manipulation and searching techniques based on a health condition. Moreover, you will acquire skills in dynamically generating reports within a webpage, showcasing statistical insights derived from the data. This practical exercise also emphasizes the application of data-driven decision making in healthcare analytics.

The insights and skills acquired through working on this healthcare data analysis interface project will form a solid basis for your final project.

## Learning objectives:

1. Interactive data input interface: Develop an understanding of front-end web development by creating an interactive interface for collecting patient data. You will learn to use HTML forms and input elements, validate user input, and handle various types of data entry (text, radio buttons, number inputs, and dropdowns).

2. Data processing and analysis: Learn data management and searching techniques using JavaScript. You will explore data manipulation concepts such as storing data in arrays of objects and filtering data based on conditions.

3. Dynamic report generation: You will dynamically generate and display reports within a webpage. This action involves updating the HTML content based on the processed data, presenting statistical information in an organized and understandable manner, and manipulating the DOM to reflect changes instantly.

4. User interaction and event handling: Practice event-driven programming and user interaction. You will learn how to handle user-triggered events (button clicks and navigation links) and respond with appropriate search queries.
